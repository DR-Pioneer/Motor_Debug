# Motor_Debug
This is a software tool based on FOC/BLDC motor control strategies, which generates corresponding control code according to the chip model and packaging method. It aims to quickly demonstrate motor solutions and provide motor parameter tuning functions.

## Guide
- In the new configuration, select the appropriate control method/chip/package.
- In the parameter navigation on the left, select the appropriate control parameters for the motor.
- Quick switching between motor control pins, multiplexing, and multiplexing functions can be achieved without opening the chip reference manual.
- You can perform compilation, linking, and downloading functions without opening the Keil software.
## Requisites
- install the JLink driver https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/.
